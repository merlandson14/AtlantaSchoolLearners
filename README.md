# Atlanta School Learners
# __a report by Christiano Hernandez and Margaret Erlandson__
Exploratory look at Atlanta, GA, schools and surrounding counties for trends between demographics and high test achievers.

## Data
Data was collected from local government records and assimilated into Excel by C. Hernandez. Demographic fields included School District or County name, Zip Code, Total Population (in zip code), Male, Female, numbers for each Race, Adjusted Average Gross Income (AGI), numbers of persons holding Bachelor+ and Graduate+ degrees, and Population Density. Counted fields included total number of test takers and then percentages of each skill level (Beginner, Developing, Proficient, and Distinguished) in each of four academic categories (Math, English, Science, and Social Studies).

## Question
Is there any correlation between race, income, degrees, or other demographic and the number of high test takers (Distinguished group)?

## Conclusions
There is a definite linear trend between AGI and Bachelor and Graduate degrees. There is also a strong trend with AGI and Race to high test takers in all academics.
